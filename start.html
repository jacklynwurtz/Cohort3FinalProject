            <strong>The United States is experiencing a housing crisis like no other time in its history. </strong>
            <p>Housing insecurity has affected people of all backgrounds, including families, students, people
                with advanced degrees, people with mental and physical disabilities, veterans, senior citizens, and
                people
                with job skills no longer in demand. The housing-burdened in the U.S. comprises nearly 37.8 million
                families
                who are spending 30% of their income on housing costs, and almost 18.2 million families who are spending

            <strong>We Want to Help</strong>
            <p>We were tasked with creating a resource for families looking for affordable
                housing/purchasing opportunities, but as we did our research, we found that families weren't the only
                ones in need of assistance, and we were compelled to help as many affected as we can.
